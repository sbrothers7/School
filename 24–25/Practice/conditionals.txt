Pay Slip Problem

Write a program to compute an employee’s weekly pay and print a pay slip showing gross pay, tax deductions, and net pay.
Input to the program should consist of the following items:
- the hourly rate of pay: an integer number (e.g. 25000)
- the number of hours worked that week: an integer number
- the employee’s tax category: a letter referring to certain percentile of the gross pay that is to be deducted:

=============================
Letter		Deduction
=============================
A			no tax deductions
B			6% tax
C			15% tax
D			24% tax
E			35% tax

When performing the calculations take into account that any hours over 40 are paid at double the normal hourly rate!
Follow these steps to write the program:
	•	First ask the three questions and store the answers into three variables.
	•	Next, calculate the gross pay, taking into account the double rate for overtime hours.
	•	Then calculate the tax as a percentage from the gross pay, based on the tax category.
	•	Finally, output the gross pay, the tax deductions, and what is left as net pay.

Example:

Welcome to the PaySlip Calculator

Enter your hourly rate: 10000
How many hours did you work this week: 50
Enter your tax category: C

Gross Pay: $600000
Tax Deduction: $90000
Net Pay: $510000
